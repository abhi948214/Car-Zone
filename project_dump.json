        "description": "<p>Known for making exquisite luxury sedans and breath taking super sports cars, British car major, Jaguar has entered the luxury SUV space with its F-Pace crossover. Based on the CX-17 concept shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 2013, the Jaguar F-Pace turns a new leaf in the Jaguar scheme of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For true Jag lovers, it is good news as the zesty manufacturer has not made drastic changes on the production model compared to its concept prototype. It gets the signature radiator grille with a chrome interlinked mesh and a screaming Jaguar logo in the centre. Inspired by the F-Type, the F-Pace does not tend to cling on bulk and instead brings in a sleek modern-meets-contemporary athletic design. On the side, the multi-spoke alloy wheels, flared wheel arches and a well sculpted shoulder line make it look fast. The rear is a clear give away of its inspiration from F-Type with sleek tail lamps running along the width.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of performance, the F-Pace comes with two diesel engine options &ndash; the 2.0-litre inline four turbodiesel and the 3.0-litre V6 turbocharged engine. The 2.0-litre mill develops 177bhp of power and 400Nm of torque and comes with the entry-level trims. The 3.0-litre V6 belts out 296bhp of power and a massive 700Nm of torque and is offered with the R-Sport and the First Edition trims. Both engines are mated to an eight-speed manual gearbox that sends power to all four-wheels depending upon the torque demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interiors are luxurious and classy even for the fabric seats offered on the 2.0-litre F-Paces. On the equipment front though, there is no compromise with everything from power seats to sunroof to touch-screen infotainment, driving modes et al being standard. The higher trim levels get additional equipment including sportier bumpers, chrome packages, adaptive headlamps, larger wheels and expensive interior materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The price range of the Jaguar F-Pace spans wide. The 2.0-litres compete with the Mercedes GLE and the BMW X5 while the larger engined F-Pace looks to compete with the Porsche Macan and the GLE 450 AMG Coupe.</p>",
